# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Star Conquest is a minimalist turn-based strategy game: a graph star map where
systems are nodes and spacelanes are edges, one ship type, take every system to
win. Python 3.12+, pygame for presentation, `uv` for dependency management.

## Commands

```sh
uv run python main.py                          # opens the setup menu
uv run python main.py --players 4 --mode symmetric   # CLI args pre-fill the menu
uv run python main.py --seed 42 --nodes 24     # pre-fill a reproducible map
uv run python main.py --no-menu --autoplay     # skip the menu; AI plays every seat (demo)

uv run pytest                         # full suite
uv run pytest tests/test_engine.py    # one file
uv run pytest tests/test_engine.py::test_production_cadence   # one test

uv run python -m tests.sim --seed 1 --verbose    # watch one AI-vs-AI game
uv run python -m tests.sim --trials 200          # batch stats (winners, length, timeouts)
```

There is no linter configured; match the surrounding style.

## Architecture

The whole point of the layout is a hard split between a **pure simulation core**
and a **thin pygame presentation shell**, so the entire game is testable
headlessly. Respect these boundaries — they are load-bearing, not stylistic:

- **Core — imports no pygame:** `model`, `geometry`, `mapgen`, `combat`,
  `engine`, `ai`, `settings`, `fog`, `replay`. This is what lets `tests/sim.py`
  and most of the suite run with no display. Do not add a pygame import to any of
  these. (`fog` is presentation-only visibility — pure hop-distance queries the
  shell reads each turn; the engine and AI never consult it. `replay` serializes a
  match to JSON and replays it back through the headless engine — see Persistence
  & replay below.)
- **Shell — the only pygame modules:** `render`, `input`, `menu`, and `main`.
  - `render.py` reads `GameState` + `Ui` and draws; it **never mutates them and
    never imports `engine` or `ai`**. Derived display stats (threat, inbound,
    per-player production rate) are computed with local helpers rather than
    reaching into `ai`.
  - `input.py` mutates **only** `Ui` (and queues human `Order`s); it never
    touches the simulation. It returns a high-level action string
    (`"end_turn"`, `"toggle_play"`, `"toggle_autoplay"`, `"toggle_history"`,
    `"rewind"`, `"restart"`, `"menu"`, `"quit"`) or `None`, and `main.py` decides
    what to do with it.
  - `menu.py` is a self-contained pre-game scene with the same draw/mutate split:
    `draw` only reads `Settings`, `handle_event` mutates `MenuState`/`Settings`
    and returns `"start"`/`"quit"`/`None`. `main.py` runs a two-scene
    (`"menu"` ⇄ `"game"`) state machine and builds the `GameState` on `"start"`.
    `menu.pump` is the second half of the mutate side: a per-frame poll `main.py`
    calls while the menu is up, for text that never reaches the SDL event queue
    (see `softkeyboard` below).
  - `softkeyboard.py` is a browser-only bridge, not a pygame module: on a touch
    browser it focuses a hidden DOM `<input>` so the mobile on-screen keyboard
    actually appears (SDL's `start_text_input` has nothing to focus there) and
    reports back what was typed. Everything is guarded — off the web build, on a
    desktop browser, or if any DOM call fails, every function is a no-op and the
    menu keeps its plain SDL text path.

### Turn resolution (engine.py)

Turns resolve **simultaneously**: `end_turn` collects every player's orders
against the *same* unchanged start-of-turn state, then applies them together, so
there is no turn-order advantage. The phase order inside `end_turn` is
deliberate and combat/production correctness depends on it: AI decisions →
advance fleets → arrivals+combat (fleets arriving at a node are grouped and
resolved together, launch-order independent) → production (after combat, so a
system captured this turn produces for its new owner) → win check → `turn += 1`.

**The engine never imports the AI.** The decision function is injected as the
`decide` parameter to `end_turn`; `main.py` and `tests/sim.py` pass `ai.decide`,
a per-seat dispatcher that routes each seat to its named strategy
(`ai.STRATEGIES`, keyed by `Player.ai_strategy`; `ai.decide` falls back to the
built-in `"heuristic"` for any unknown name, so a stale/missing strategy never
crashes). Keep this inversion — it is why the core has no AI dependency, and it is
the seam for user-written AIs (`ai.register(name, fn)`, `fn(state, pid) -> list[Order]`).

**Drop-in custom AIs.** `ai.load_models()` imports every `*.py` in the
`models/` dir (repo-anchored `ai.MODELS_DIR`, mirroring `menu._SAVE_DIR`) and
`register`s each file's `decide` under its stem; a file that fails to import or
lacks `decide` is skipped. `main.py` calls it at startup and on game start;
`ai.available_strategies()` feeds the menu's per-seat Strategy dropdown. `menu.py`
is the one shell module that imports `ai` (for discovery) — fine, since `ai` is
pure core (no pygame); the render/input prohibition on importing `ai` still holds.
`models/` is committed (not gitignored) precisely so `tools/build_web.sh` can
stage it alongside `starconquest/` and ship the same bots to the browser/PWA
build — new bots go in via commit/PR, not local drop-in only.

`apply_order` deducts ships from the source at launch, so a fleet is "off the
board" in transit (fleets on lanes never interact); order-issuing has no bearing
on outcomes.

### Persistence, replay & history (replay.py)

A match is **never snapshotted** — it is recorded as its *inputs*: `Settings`,
the concrete `seed`, and each turn's human orders (`replay.GameLog`, auto-saved
after every turn to a gitignored, repo-anchored `games/` dir, mirroring
`ai.MODELS_DIR` and `menu._SAVE_DIR`). Because all randomness flows through
`state.rng`, `replay.reconstruct(log, decide, on_turn=…)` replays those inputs
back through `engine.end_turn` to rebuild the **exact** state at any turn,
bit-identical (keeping the engine's AI inversion — `decide` is a parameter, not an
import). Under autoplay the human seat is AI-driven and draws `rng` *before*
opponents, so those turns are flagged (`"ai": true`) and `reconstruct` re-runs
`decide` for the human seat to reproduce the draw order. `main.resume_game` uses
this to offer resuming the last unfinished match from the menu.

**History mode** is a shell-only review scene (`Ui.history`, gated so it never
enters the pure core). On entry `main.build_history` runs one `reconstruct` whose
`on_turn` callback deep-copies each turn's board and folds fog (via
`_accumulate_fog`) into a per-turn snapshot, so the bottom-bar scrubber seeks by
plain list-indexing. Fog stays a `Ui`-layer concern: mid-game a past turn shows
fog *as it was then*, while a finished game is fully revealed. **Rewind** resumes
live play from the viewed turn — mid-game it truncates the same log file
(`GameLog.truncate`, confirmed first, since it discards later turns); on a
finished game it forks a new file (`GameLog.fork`) so the completed record stays
intact.

### Key conventions

- **All balance/aesthetic constants live in `config.py`.** Do not hardcode a
  magic number elsewhere — add a named constant there. Tuning the game means
  editing that one file. Every module reads `config.X` *live* at call time
  (nothing is cached at import), so the Advanced menu tunes copies on a
  `Settings`, and `settings._apply_globals` (called by `build_state` just before
  generation) is the single writer that pushes them back into `config`.
- **`settings.Settings` is the pure, serializable pre-game config** (players,
  map, seed, global knobs, per-seat AI); `menu.MenuState` holds transient menu
  interaction state (analogous to `Ui`). `settings.build_state(settings, seed)`
  is the one funnel from menu/CLI to a `GameState`. `to_dict`/`from_dict` back
  both the JSON file Save/Load (menu footer, gitignored `saves/`) and a
  `to_token`/`from_token` pair (compact base64url JSON) that encodes a whole
  config into a URL fragment. On the web build the menu's "Get Link" button
  writes that token to `location.hash` (and best-effort to the clipboard) so a
  setup can be shared as a link, and `main._apply_shared_link` decodes a
  `#<token>` back onto `Settings` at boot — same effect as CLI args pre-filling
  the menu. Because an installed PWA launches from the manifest's fixed
  `start_url` (no fragment), the token is also mirrored to `localStorage`
  (key `paths.WEB_SHARED_SETTINGS_KEY`) and read back as a fallback, so a shared
  config survives installation. `from_token`/`from_dict` are deliberately
  tolerant (clamp, default, pad), so a stale or hand-edited token still loads to
  a playable config.
- **AI is per-seat and pluggable.** Each `Player` carries `ai_strategy` (a key
  into `ai.STRATEGIES`) and `ai_params` (`model.AiParams`, defaults mirroring
  the `config.AI_*` constants). `ai.compute_orders` reads the seat's params, so
  seats can play to different profiles; the menu's AI tab edits them per seat.
  `Settings` mirrors both per-seat lists (`ai: list[AiParams]`, `ai_strategy:
  list[str]`, indexed by seat-1), and `build_state` stamps each non-neutral
  `Player` with its `seat_strategy(...)` and a copy of its `seat_params(...)`.
- **All randomness flows through `state.rng`** (a seeded `random.Random`). A
  seed fully reproduces a map *and* every battle. Never call the global `random`
  module in core code, and keep new map-gen / combat code deterministic given
  the seed (`test_mapgen.py` asserts this). The *unreproducible* rolls — picking
  a fresh seed, the menu's dice buttons — go through `settings.random_seed()` /
  `settings.fresh_rng()`, which mix the clock and a per-call counter into a
  throwaway RNG rather than using the global `random`: the web build boots from a
  fixed interpreter image, so `random`'s auto-seeding can hand out the same
  "random" seeds on every page load.
- **Everything is keyed by integer id.** Systems are `dict[int, System]`; lanes
  use a canonical order-independent `frozenset` key (`model.lane_key`). Neutral
  is a real player with `id == 0`.
- **`viewstate.Ui` holds all transient interaction state**, including human-only
  quality-of-life features (e.g. `auto_forward` standing rules) that must stay
  out of the pure `GameState`. `main.resolve_turn` expands such UI state into
  `Order`s at end-of-turn.
- **`tests/sim.py` is both a demo harness and a test fixture.** Because it drives
  the pure core headlessly, the suite uses it to assert games actually terminate
  and never corrupt state (`check_invariants`). After changing `ai.py` or
  travel/combat balance, run a `--trials` batch and watch the timeout rate.

Map generation (`mapgen.py`) has two modes: `random` (jittered-grid placement +
light relaxation + a Euclidean MST for connectivity, which is planar so edges
don't cross, plus a few crossing-rejected extra edges for loops) and `symmetric`
(one base sector rotated N times about a shared contested centre for a perfectly
fair start). Both must stay connected and planar-ish — `test_mapgen.py` guards
both.
