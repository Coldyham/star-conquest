# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

Star Conquest is a minimalist turn-based strategy game: a graph star map where
systems are nodes and spacelanes are edges, one ship type, take every system to
win. Python 3.12+, pygame for presentation, `uv` for dependency management.

## Commands

```sh
uv run python main.py                          # opens the setup menu
uv run python main.py --players 4 --mode symmetric   # CLI args pre-fill the menu
uv run python main.py --seed 42 --nodes 24     # pre-fill a reproducible map
uv run python main.py --no-menu --autoplay     # skip the menu; AI plays every seat (demo)

uv run pytest                         # full suite
uv run pytest tests/test_engine.py    # one file
uv run pytest tests/test_engine.py::test_production_cadence   # one test

uv run python -m tests.sim --seed 1 --verbose    # watch one AI-vs-AI game
uv run python -m tests.sim --trials 200          # batch stats (winners, length, timeouts)
```

There is no linter configured; match the surrounding style.

## Architecture

The whole point of the layout is a hard split between a **pure simulation core**
and a **thin pygame presentation shell**, so the entire game is testable
headlessly. Respect these boundaries — they are load-bearing, not stylistic:

- **Core — imports no pygame:** `model`, `geometry`, `mapgen`, `combat`,
  `engine`, `ai`, `settings`. This is what lets `tests/sim.py` and most of the
  suite run with no display. Do not add a pygame import to any of these.
- **Shell — the only pygame modules:** `render`, `input`, `menu`, and `main`.
  - `render.py` reads `GameState` + `Ui` and draws; it **never mutates them and
    never imports `engine` or `ai`**. Derived display stats (threat, inbound,
    per-player production rate) are computed with local helpers rather than
    reaching into `ai`.
  - `input.py` mutates **only** `Ui` (and queues human `Order`s); it never
    touches the simulation. It returns a high-level action string
    (`"end_turn"`, `"restart"`, `"quit"`, `"toggle_autoplay"`, `"menu"`) or
    `None`, and `main.py` decides what to do with it.
  - `menu.py` is a self-contained pre-game scene with the same draw/mutate split:
    `draw` only reads `Settings`, `handle_event` mutates `MenuState`/`Settings`
    and returns `"start"`/`"quit"`/`None`. `main.py` runs a two-scene
    (`"menu"` ⇄ `"game"`) state machine and builds the `GameState` on `"start"`.

### Turn resolution (engine.py)

Turns resolve **simultaneously**: `end_turn` collects every player's orders
against the *same* unchanged start-of-turn state, then applies them together, so
there is no turn-order advantage. The phase order inside `end_turn` is
deliberate and combat/production correctness depends on it: AI decisions →
advance fleets → arrivals+combat (fleets arriving at a node are grouped and
resolved together, launch-order independent) → production (after combat, so a
system captured this turn produces for its new owner) → win check → `turn += 1`.

**The engine never imports the AI.** The decision function is injected as the
`decide` parameter to `end_turn`; `main.py` and `tests/sim.py` pass `ai.decide`,
a per-seat dispatcher that routes each seat to its named strategy
(`ai.STRATEGIES`, keyed by `Player.ai_strategy`; only `"heuristic"` is built in).
Keep this inversion — it is why the core has no AI dependency, and it is the seam
for user-written AIs (`ai.register(name, fn)`, `fn(state, pid) -> list[Order]`).

`apply_order` deducts ships from the source at launch, so a fleet is "off the
board" in transit (fleets on lanes never interact); order-issuing has no bearing
on outcomes.

### Key conventions

- **All balance/aesthetic constants live in `config.py`.** Do not hardcode a
  magic number elsewhere — add a named constant there. Tuning the game means
  editing that one file. Every module reads `config.X` *live* at call time
  (nothing is cached at import), so the Advanced menu tunes copies on a
  `Settings`, and `settings._apply_globals` (called by `build_state` just before
  generation) is the single writer that pushes them back into `config`.
- **`settings.Settings` is the pure, serializable pre-game config** (players,
  map, seed, global knobs, per-seat AI); `menu.MenuState` holds transient menu
  interaction state (analogous to `Ui`). `settings.build_state(settings, seed)`
  is the one funnel from menu/CLI to a `GameState`.
- **AI is per-seat and pluggable.** Each `Player` carries `ai_strategy` (a key
  into `ai.STRATEGIES`) and `ai_params` (`model.AiParams`, defaults mirroring
  the `config.AI_*` constants). `ai.compute_orders` reads the seat's params, so
  seats can play to different profiles; the menu's AI tab edits them per seat.
- **All randomness flows through `state.rng`** (a seeded `random.Random`). A
  seed fully reproduces a map *and* every battle. Never call the global `random`
  module in core code, and keep new map-gen / combat code deterministic given
  the seed (`test_mapgen.py` asserts this).
- **Everything is keyed by integer id.** Systems are `dict[int, System]`; lanes
  use a canonical order-independent `frozenset` key (`model.lane_key`). Neutral
  is a real player with `id == 0`.
- **`viewstate.Ui` holds all transient interaction state**, including human-only
  quality-of-life features (e.g. `auto_forward` standing rules) that must stay
  out of the pure `GameState`. `main.resolve_turn` expands such UI state into
  `Order`s at end-of-turn.
- **`tests/sim.py` is both a demo harness and a test fixture.** Because it drives
  the pure core headlessly, the suite uses it to assert games actually terminate
  and never corrupt state (`check_invariants`). After changing `ai.py` or
  travel/combat balance, run a `--trials` batch and watch the timeout rate.

Map generation (`mapgen.py`) has two modes: `random` (jittered-grid placement +
light relaxation + a Euclidean MST for connectivity, which is planar so edges
don't cross, plus a few crossing-rejected extra edges for loops) and `symmetric`
(one base sector rotated N times about a shared contested centre for a perfectly
fair start). Both must stay connected and planar-ish — `test_mapgen.py` guards
both.
